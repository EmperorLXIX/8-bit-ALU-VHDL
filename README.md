# 8-bit-ALU-VHDL
My First Big Project , after completion of a fast paced, self learnt course on Embedded Electronics.
The idea was to build an 8 bit ALU, which can perform basic logical and arithmetical 8 bit operations. The Language chosen is VHDL. 
The reason I chose to do this project, was out of interest, knowing the history of the microprocessors and their anatomy.
The ALU or Arithmetic Logical Unit , is at the heart of the CPU, where all the mathematical and logical operations are done. 
8 bit ALUs have become obsolete these days and presently, much more capable models are used industrially. 
The humble 8085 microprocessor had an 8 bit ALU. It was an 8 bit microprocessor, with 8 bit data bus and 16 bit address bus.
8085 microprocessor was developed in 1976. Then came 8086, and the family of 8086 microprocessors, all having similar architecture, which are presently being termed as X86 architecture. 
Presently, as technology advances, these chips get smaller and smaller, yet the basic functionality remains the same. This project really excited me and inspired me to further get involved with electronics.
I hope that, I could explain the context of this project to the reader.

Thank You.
